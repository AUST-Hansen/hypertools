=============================
Using describe_pca to evaluate the integrity of your visualization
=============================

The downside to using dimensionality reduction to visualize your data is that
some variance will likely be removed. To help get a sense for the integrity of your low
dimensional visualizations, we built the `describe` function, which computes
the covariance (samples by samples) of both the raw and reduced datasets, and
plots their correlation.

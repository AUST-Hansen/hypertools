Chemtrails
=============================

The past trajectory of an animated plot can be visualized with the chemtrails
argument.  This displays a low opacity version of the trace behind the
current points being plotted.  This can be used in conjunction with the
precog argument to plot a low-opacity trace of the entire timeseries.

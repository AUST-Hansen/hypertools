Plotting text
=============================

To plot text, simply pass the text data to the plot function.  By default, the
text samples will be transformed into a vector of word counts and then modeled
using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (# of topics = 20).  If you specify
text_model=None, the word count vectors will be plotted. To convert the text to
a matrix (or list of matrices), we also expose the text2mat function.

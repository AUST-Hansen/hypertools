=============================
Choosing the thumbnail figure
=============================

An example to demonstrate how to choose which figure is displayed as the
thumbnail if the example generates more than one figure. This is done by
specifying the keyword-value pair ``sphinx_gallery_thumbnail_number = 2`` as a
comment somewhere below the docstring in the example file.
